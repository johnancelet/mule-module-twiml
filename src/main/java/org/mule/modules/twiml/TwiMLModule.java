/**
 * A Mule module for generating Twilios Markup Language. Twilio can handle instructions for calls and SMS messages in
 * real time from iON applications. When an SMS or incoming call is received, Twilio looks up the iON app associated
 * with the phone number called and makes a request to it. iON will respond to the request and that response will
 * decides how the call should proceed by returning a Twilio Markup XML (TwiML) document telling Twilio to say text
 * to the caller, send an SMS message, play audio files, get input from the keypad, record audio, connect the call
 * to another phone and more.
 * <p/>
 * TwiML is similar to HTML. Just as HTML is rendered in a browser to display a webpage, TwiML is 'rendered' by Twilio
 * to the caller. Only one TwiML document is rendered to the caller at once but many documents can be linked together
 * to build complex interactive voice applications.
 * <p/>
 * Outgoing calls are controlled in the same manner as incoming calls using TwiML. The initial flow for the call is
 * provided as a parameter to the Twilio Cloud Connector.

     * @param timeout        Sets the limit in seconds that Twilio will wait for the caller to press another digit before
     *                       moving on and making a request to the 'action' flow. For example, if 'timeout' is
     *                       '10', Twilio will wait ten seconds for the caller to press another key before submitting the previously entered
     *                       digits to the 'action' flow. Twilio waits until completing the execution of all nested verbs before beginning
     *                       the timeout period.
     * @param finishOnKey    The 'finishOnKey' attribute lets you choose one value that submits the received data when
     *                       entered. For example, if you set 'finishOnKey' to '#' and the user enters '1234#', Twilio will immediately
     *                       stop waiting for more input when the '#' is received and will submit "Digits=1234" to the 'action' flow.
     * @param numDigits      The 'numDigits' attribute lets you set the number of digits you are expecting, and submits
     *                       the data to the 'action' flow once the caller enters that number of digits. For example, one might set
     *                       'numDigits' to '5' and ask the caller to enter a 5 digit zip code. When the caller enters the fifth digit
     *                       of '94117', Twilio will immediately submit the data to the 'action' flow.

     * @param finishOnKey      The 'finishOnKey' attribute lets you choose a set of digits that end the recording when
     *                         entered. For example, if you set 'finishOnKey' to '#' and the caller presses '#', Twilio will immediately

     *                         will end the recording). Unlike <Gather>, you may specify more than one character as a 'finishOnKey' value.

     *                         you set 'maxLength' to '30', the recording will automatically end after 30 seconds of recorded time has
     *                         elapsed. This defaults to 3600 seconds (one hour) for a normal recording and 120 seconds (two minutes) for
     *                         a transcribed recording.
     * @param shouldTranscribe The 'transcribe' attribute tells Twilio that you would like a text representation of
     *                         the audio of the recording. Twilio will pass this recording to our speech-to-text engine and attempt to
     *                         convert the audio to human readable text. The 'transcribe' option is off by default. If you do not wish to
     *                         perform transcription, simply do not include the transcribe attribute.
     * @param transcribe       The 'transcribeCallback' attribute is used in conjunction with the 'transcribe' attribute. It
     *                         allows you to specify a flow to which Twilio will make an asynchronous request when the transcription is
     *                         complete.

     * @param timeout      The 'timeout' attribute sets the limit in seconds that <Dial> waits for the called party to
     *                     answer the call. Basically, how long should Twilio let the call ring before giving up and reporting 'no-answer'
     *                     as the 'DialCallStatus'.
     * @param hangupOnStar The 'hangupOnStar' attribute lets the calling party hang up on the called party by pressing
     *                     the '*' key on his phone. When two parties are connected using <Dial>, Twilio blocks execution of further verbs
     *                     until the caller or called party hangs up. This feature allows the calling party to hang up on the called party
     *                     without having to hang up her phone and ending her TwiML processing session. When the caller presses '*' Twilio
     *                     will hang up on the called party. If an 'action' URL was provided, Twilio submits 'completed' as the
     *                     'DialCallStatus' to the URL and processes the response. If no 'action' was provided Twilio will continue on to
     *                     the next verb in the current TwiML document.
     * @param timeLimit    The 'timeLimit' attribute sets the maximum duration of the <Dial> in seconds. For example, by
     *                     setting a time limit of 120 seconds <Dial> will hang up on the called party automatically two minutes into
     *                     the phone call. By default, there is a four hour time limit set on calls.
     * @param callerId     The 'callerId' attribute lets you specify the caller ID that will appear to the called party
     *                     when Twilio calls. By default, when you put a <Dial> in your TwiML response to Twilio's inbound call request,
     *                     the caller ID that the dialed party sees is the inbound caller's caller ID.
     *                     <p/>
     *                     For example, an inbound caller to your Twilio number has the caller ID 1-415-123-4567. You tell Twilio to
     *                     execute a <Dial> verb to 1-858-987-6543 to handle the inbound call. The called party (1-858-987-6543) will
     *                     see 1-415-123-4567 as the caller ID on the incoming call.
     * @param nestedProcessors The response of this processor will be used as the inner content of the dial element.
     * @return TwiML-based markup representing the Dial operation
     * @throws Exception is bubbled up from processing any nested elements
